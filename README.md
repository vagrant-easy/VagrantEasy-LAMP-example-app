# VagrantEasy LAMP Example App

Example PHP app to test [VagrantEasy-LAMP](https://github.com/vagrant-easy/VagrantEasy-LAMP/) with.

### What's this?

This is an example PHP application to be run under a LAMP environment (Linux with Apache, MySQL, and PHP).

Even though you can get this application running on virtually any LAMP environment with a few tweaks, it has been optimized to be implemented along with the [VagrantEasy LAMP](https://github.com/vagrant-easy/VagrantEasy-LAMP/) boilerplate.

### How does it work?

You can head on over to the [Setting up](https://github.com/vagrant-easy/VagrantEasy-LAMP-example-app/wiki/Setting-up) wiki page to view further instructions on how to properly set up the VagrantEasy LAMP box and this example application together.
